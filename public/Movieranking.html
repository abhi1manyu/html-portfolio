    <h3> The Dark Knigth </h3>
<p> This movie is truly one of the best movies of all time. Heath Ledger's performance rightfully won the Oscars.
    It also has on of the most unique quotes "You either die a hero or You live long enough to see yourself become the villain "<p>
        <h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
        <p> Cinematic masterpiece, truly one of Nolans greatest films. It really dives into the mind of oppenheimer and the guilt he would have felt after developing such a weapon. 
            Amazing soundtrack, all with only 1 big bomb blast.<p>
            <h3>Angels and Demons</h3>
            <p> Based off the best selling book written by Dan Brown, Angels and Demons is action packed and doesn't fail to impress.
                It also shines a limelight on the dark past of the church. Doesn't fail to surprise the audience either.<p>
